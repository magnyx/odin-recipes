Recipes Website written in HTML - TheOdinProject

This is a Project that will summarize everything I have learned about HTML (as well as Linux, Git, GitHub and VSCode) so far.

The Project involves:
1. Developing a website in HTML
2. Using the tools: Linux-Terminal, VSCode, Git
3. Hosting it on GitHub

By the end of this Project, I will be:
 Apt to create and launch a simple website in HTML through a Linux OS.

Update Dec 3, 2024:
Since HTML structure is done, I will now:
 1. Apply newly learned concepts on CSS as I learn, until I'm satisfied
 2. Try new things for the purpose of learning
