    <hr>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <!--Try to make "diamond class" look like a Losenge if possible-->
    <ul class="diamond">
    <li>Strawberries</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Lemon juice</li></ul>

<h3>How to make Strawberry Jelly</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Wash the strawberries well and cut them in small pieces</li>
    <li>Put the strawberries on a wide pan, as well as the sugar, and heat it up</li>
    <li>Pour the lemon juice and sugar as you like, but don't overdo the sugar!</li>
    <li>Don't let it burn, keep stirring until it's consistent and the jam starts getting thick enough: twist the pan around and see if it doesn't roam around as easily</li>
    <li>When it reaches the right point, pour it on a jar and just cool it off for a few minutes before trying it out yourself! 
    <br>Voil√°, strawberry jam!</li></ol>
